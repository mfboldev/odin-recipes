        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken is a dish
        consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with 
        seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.
        The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken
        while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used. </p>
